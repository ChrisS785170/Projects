                    DodgyCode is the group that created DodgyClubs, with a passion for coding and supporting extra-curricular activities in
                    Universities in Adelaide. All of us are thrilled to have nearly launched this exciting new website to the University of
                    Adelaide.
                    Coordinating, managing and taking part in student clubs and organisations can be very time consuming. This is why we have
                    developed a product that will efficiently support club advertising, as well as creating and managing club events, enabling
                    their members and moderators to focus on what is most important, having fun!

                    The purpose of DodgyClubs is to be a haven for clubs and people who are searching for potential clubs to join. It is a
                    platform that allows its administrators and club managers to improve communication by easily allowing them to post
                    events and updates, as well as view and manage members or event attendees joining clubs.
                    Users are encouraged to find clubs most suited for them, and meet people who have similar interests. It is specifically
                    marketed for students studying in Adelaide, as the app was created there. It strives to encourage students to enjoy their
                    tertiary education by getting involved in fun and engaging activities.
